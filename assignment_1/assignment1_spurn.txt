For testing, check and write down answers to the following questions:

The processing time for one video frame or image.
>> 0.2470531463623047 sek is the processing time for the code to read and process the image/video

How does the processing time change when you add the bright spot detection?
>> 0.2509438991546631 sek when running the bright spot in built function.
>> 0.28196167945861816 sek using the for loop code to find the bright spot

Is the processing time identical when you do not display the image?
>> no, it is faster
>> 0.1454637050628662 sek when running the bright spot in built function.
>> 0.18261241912841797 sek using the for loop code to find the bright spot

How does your for-loop implementation compare to the built-in function? (nota imshow og mæli tímann á milli þess þegar kóðinn byrjar að runna og þangað til hann birtir myndina.
Eftir imshow()).
running both most brightness and reddest code. 
>> Built in functions in opencv
>> fps = 30
>> 0.25275444984436035 sek
>> For loops
>> fps = 15 with for-loop
>> 0.6331415176391602

Moving your hand in front of the camera, estimate the latency between image capture and display.
>> I would estimate 300 ms latency

Is the latency different when capturing from a mobile phone?
>> Yes, little bit more lag, I would estimate around 0.5 sek.
